Coup.js
=======

Tiny script plays client side with CouchDB rewrites, lists and shows.

With Couch.js you can build a web that

1. Render html server side on first request
2. Handle subsequent calls client side

This technique results in 

* fast pageload
* SEO friendly
* less bandwidth
* less CPU usage

Coup.js consists of a small client side and an even smaller server side library.

On *server side*, inside your _show_ or _list_ function, you `require("lib/coup.couch.js")`
and call `coup.show()` respectively `coup.list()`, which render the templates
based on query parameters, which you set in the rewrite rules.

On *client side* you include the `coup.js` script and call `Coup()`.
The rewrite rules gets parsed and handed over to [page.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js).
Now the client takes control over the rendering of the page, fetching the views and docs
via ajax requests.


### rewrites

Define the route with a template:

    {
      "from": ":id",
      "to": "_show/layout/:id",
      "query": {
        "template": "page"
      }
    }

### models

Think of Coup.js models as of transform functions, which takes the json of a document
or a view as input and returns an object, which is used as a view in mustache:

    exports.view = function(doc) {
      doc.profile_image_url = '/' + encodeURIComponent(doc._id) + '/profile_image.jpg';

      return doc;
    };

### templates

The [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) templates are stored inside the design document.

    <h2>{{title}}</h2>
    <img src="{{{profile_image_url}}}">


### shows and lists

Require `coup` and call it:

    function(doc, req) {
      return require('lib/coup').show(this, doc, req);
    }



Look at [examples](coup.js/tree/master/examples).

API

Equivalents to `Coup.app(ddoc).start(options)`.


### Coup.app(ddoc)

Register a coup app.

Limitations
-----------

* Views are not streamed, they are kept in RAM, so you have to limit the views.
